            Every day, often without us thinking about it, we participate in "smart city" activities, such as
            smart mobility, smart health services and smart technology. Oslo is one of the most developed
            smart cities in Europe 
            <a href="https://www.theagilityeffect.com/en/case/oslo-leads-the-way-in-green-and-inclusive-smart-cities//">(The Agility Effect, 2019)</a>
            , and as students in this city, we participate in a
            number of smart activities. Public transportation is one activity that we all use almost every day,
            and rely on to travel efficiently. For example, Google maps or the “Ruter-app” will give
            alternatives for how to get from one place to another, whether it’s by walking, a combination of
            public transport options or by biking. You also get to see the time that is left before your
            transportation arrives on either the metro or the bus station.
            Another type of smart activity that we often participate in, is smart transactions. This can be for
            example the “Vipps-app”, self checkout in stores, payment and ordering with QR codes and
            through IoT devices. These payment alternatives are time saving and relatively easy to use for
            both us customers and for the other party.
            One smart activity that students especially get to experience a lot is remote teaching. This has
            escalated after the COVID-19 pandemic, but is probably here to stay as it allows freedom to
            participate in education from wherever fits the student.

            The corona crisis has changed every-day life for everyone, and new innovations have helped us
            maintain somewhat of a normal life, despite having to keep a distance from other people. One
            example of this is digital health services, like video conferences with doctors and psychologists.
            This is something that hasn't been used in Norway before the pandemic, but that is now offered
            by many doctors 
            <a href="https://www.theagilityeffect.com/en/case/oslo-leads-the-way-in-green-and-inclusive-smart-cities//">(Direktoratet for e-helse, 2020). </a>
            <a href="https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/rapporter/utredning-av-tilbud-til-horselshemmede/drofting-og-vurdering-av-tiltak/digitale-helsetjenester-e-helse-telemedisin">
            Helsedirektoratet (2020)</a> 
            points out that using video conferences as a doctor's appointment is more accessible for the patients, especially for
            those that live far away or don't have access to a car.
            Another innovation that has been taken into use on a much larger scale than before the corona
            crisis is using QR codes for ordering food and drinks at restaurants and bars. This minimizes the
            customers and servers moving about and contact between people. Besides this, it also allows for
            easier modifications to an order, and payment for one's order is done straight away so that the
            customer doesn’t have to wait for a bill when they’re done and ready to leave. This can also
            make it easier for larger groups to order and make payments individually, instead of having the
            server split the bill for them with a payment terminal.
            Both digital health services like video conferences and the use of QR codes are relatively new
            solutions that make every-day easier for most people, and they have been taken into use.
            Therefore, we think these qualify as innovations.
