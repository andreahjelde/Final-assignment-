          1. Think about to which extent and how you, as a citizen or as a student or a professional,
          participate in one or more "smart city"-initiatives, as Marikken describes them in her
          video. (From module 2.2)
        </p>


        <p>
          Every day, often without us thinking about it, we participate in "smart city" activities, such as
          smart mobility, smart health services and smart technology. Oslo is one of the most developed
          smart cities in Europe 
          <a href="https://www.theagilityeffect.com/en/case/oslo-leads-the-way-in-green-and-inclusive-smart-cities//">(The Agility Effect, 2019)</a>
          , and as students in this city, we participate in a
          number of smart activities. Public transportation is one activity that we all use almost every day,
          and rely on to travel efficiently. For example, Google maps or the “Ruter-app” will give
          alternatives for how to get from one place to another, whether it’s by walking, a combination of
          public transport options or by biking. You also get to see the time that is left before your
          transportation arrives on either the metro or the bus station.
          Another type of smart activity that we often participate in, is smart transactions. This can be for
          example the “Vipps-app”, self checkout in stores, payment and ordering with QR codes and
          through IoT devices. These payment alternatives are time saving and relatively easy to use for
          both us customers and for the other party.
          One smart activity that students especially get to experience a lot is remote teaching. This has
          escalated after the COVID-19 pandemic, but is probably here to stay as it allows freedom to
          participate in education from wherever fits the student.

          3. Tor Paaske Utheim defines innovation as something that is new, useful and implemented.
          Think about the rapid digitalization in response to the corona crisis. Do you have an
          example of something that can be categorized as an innovation in this context? Why can
          this be labeled an innovation? (From module 2.4)
        </p>

        <p>
          The corona crisis has changed every-day life for everyone, and new innovations have helped us
          maintain somewhat of a normal life, despite having to keep a distance from other people. One
          example of this is digital health services, like video conferences with doctors and psychologists.
          This is something that hasn't been used in Norway before the pandemic, but that is now offered
          by many doctors <a href="https://www.theagilityeffect.com/en/case/oslo-leads-the-way-in-green-and-inclusive-smart-cities//">(Direktoratet for e-helse, 2020).</a>
          <a href="https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/rapporter/utredning-av-tilbud-til-horselshemmede/drofting-og-vurdering-av-tiltak/digitale-helsetjenester-e-helse-telemedisin">
          Helsedirektoratet (2020)</a>points out that using
          video conferences as a doctor's appointment is more accessible for the patients, especially for
          those that live far away or don't have access to a car.
          Another innovation that has been taken into use on a much larger scale than before the corona
          crisis is using QR codes for ordering food and drinks at restaurants and bars. This minimizes the
          customers and servers moving about and contact between people. Besides this, it also allows for
          easier modifications to an order, and payment for one's order is done straight away so that the
          customer doesn’t have to wait for a bill when they’re done and ready to leave. This can also
          make it easier for larger groups to order and make payments individually, instead of having the
          server split the bill for them with a payment terminal.
          Both digital health services like video conferences and the use of QR codes are relatively new
          solutions that make every-day easier for most people, and they have been taken into use.
          Therefore, we think these qualify as innovations.
